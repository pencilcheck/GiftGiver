	user satisfaction for recommender systems in an electronic programme
	guide context},
  month = {May},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {This research will primarily focus on recommender systems that recommend
	TV programmes as part of an EPG, since the number of TV channels
	(and thus the number of TV shows) that are available increased tremendously
	due to the introduction of digital television. Therefore people watching
	television also suffer from information overloaded and recommender
	systems start to emerge in this domain},
